== Introduction

Do you find the need to maintain multiple versions of your resume?

Perhaps you find youself reorganising your resumes before making a job application?

Unlike most resume generation webapps, ResuMaker tailors your resume to fit the specific requirements of a job. +
It can also pick up contextual awareness about your world - with out-of-the-box support for the National University of Singapore's School of Computing. +

=== Creating a Contextual Event (Project / Work Experience / Skill): `nus`
There are times when we just don't want to manually enter every piece of required information into a computer programme.
After all, shouldn't some things __just be common knowledge?__

With ResuMaker, you can auto-populate resume Entries if ResuMaker already knows about them!
We call such Entries __Contextual Events__.

Format: `nus EVENT_NAME`

[TIP]
The `EVENT_NAME` can be a combination of an  Event's **full name** (Mathematics and Computer Science Double Degree Programme), **acronyms** (math - cs ddp), or even
**partially matching phrases** (math - comp sci double deg prog)

Examples:

* `nus cs2103t` +
Creates a Project Entry for `CS2103T` - A rigorous software engineering module at NUS.
* `nus ta ma1101r` OR `nus teaching asst ma1101r` +
Creates a Work Experience Entry for `Teaching Assistant MA1101R`
* `nus `computing cl exco` +
Creates a Nonacademics Entry for an Executive Commitee position in the Computing Club.

[NOTE]
Slang and acronyms must be correctly configured in application data. In future releases, ResuMaker will ship with NUS / SOC specific slang and acronyms.

[[tags]]
=== Managing Tags
These are functions to help you manage your tags; namely to view and edit the relevant tags and entries.

==== Viewing currently active tags: `tag status` [Coming in v1.4]

Lists all the tags currently active, and which will be included in the generated resume. This will effectively list out all the tags active in the current loaded template.

Format: `tag status` lists all the corresponding tags and categories that will appear in the resume.

==== Listing entries under specific tags: `tag list` or `tag ls`

List all entries under specific tags (space separated).

By default, if a tag is not given, all the tags will be displayed. +

Format: `tag ls` list all the tags and the relevant entries for each tag.

Format: `tag ls ~work ~projects #java` list all the `~work` and `~project` entries tagged with `#java`

Entries displayed will be accompanied with their relevant entry id.

==== Add particular tag to entry: `tag add` [Coming in v1.4]

Add tags (space separated) to particular entry (identified by index).

Duplicated tags will be ignored

Format: `tag add 10 ~work #java` add tag `#java` and category `~work` to entry 10.

==== Remove particular tag from entry: `tag remove` or `tag rm` [Coming in v1.4]

Remove tags (space separated) from a particular entry (identified by index).

By default, if no tags given, all tags will be removed from the entry.

Format: `tag rm 1 ~work #java` remove category `~work` and tag `#java` from entry 1.

Format: `tag rm 10` remove all tags and categories from entry 10.

==== Retagging a particular entry: `tag retag` or `tag rt` [Coming in v1.4]

Remove all current tags and replace it with current tags (space separated).

Format: `tag rt 1 ~work #java` remove all tags and categories from entry 1, adding tag `#java` and category `~work` to entry 1.

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

// tag::template[]
=== Using templates to specify resume formats
Templates are stored as text files and parsed and loaded into the application using the `loadtemplate` command.
They should be saved in the same directory as the `resumaker.jar` file.

==== Loading template : `loadtemplate`

Loads a template from a text file into the application. +
Format: `loadtemplate FILEPATH`

Examples:

* `loadtemplate google.txt` +
Loads the template specified in `google.txt`

==== Writing template files
//TODO: how do we have parallel structure for this?
Templates are written by the user as text files, consisting of lines of the following format:
-----
[Category Heading]:~[Category Tag]:[Tag Groups]
-----

Each line specifies a category, starting with the title to be displayed, its corresponding category tag, and tags used to filter entries.
Each `Tag Group` contains one `Tag`, or several separated by ampersands (&). Tag groups are separated by spaces.
For example, the following formats would all be valid as `[Tag Groups]`:
----
* [Tag] [Tag] [Tag]
* [Tag]&[Tag]
* [Tag] [Tag]&[Tag]&[Tag]
* (no tags)
----
An entry is included if it is tagged with that category, and fulfills any of the groups of tags.
It must contain all tags in a group to fulfil the group.

For example, the following category,

    Work Experience:~work:java&recent python&recent&significant datascience

means to include any entry categorized as `work`, as long as it fulfills any of the following:

* tagged with `java` and `recent`
* tagged with `python` and `recent` and `significant`
* tagged with `datascience`

As an example, the following template file:
[literal]
--
Work Experience:~work:
Education:~education:uni training&cs
Projects:~projects:software&java&recent
--
Will result in the resume being generated as follows:
[sidebar]
--
*Work Experience* +
(all work entries regardless of tags)

*Education* +
(education entries tagged with `uni`, or both `training` and `cs`)

*Projects* +
(project entries tagged with `software`, `java` and `recent`)
--
// end::template[]

// tag::resume[]
=== Generating Resume : `make`

Generates a Resume file with the given name, using the _template_ currently loaded in the application. +

[NOTE]
====
By default, the file will be saved in the same folder as the application.
You can also specify a more complicated filepath if you want the file to be saved to a specific folder.
====

Examples:

* `make sep.md` +
Generates a file named sep.md in the same folder as the application,
containing a Resume which lists entries as designated by the currently loaded template.

ResuMaker generates your resume files in the _markdown_ format, which is commonly used around the web.
Since you will likely need your resume in a different format such as a Word document or a PDF file,
here are some of the many tools out there that can help you convert your resume:

* link:http://www.writage.com/[Writage], which allows you to edit and convert markdown files in Microsoft Word.
* link:https://pandoc.org/[Pandoc], which converts markdown files to a variety of formats like PDF.
* link:https://dillinger.io/[Dillinger], which lets you edit markdown files and convert them to HTML.
