== Introduction
Welcome to the Developer Guide for ResuMaker - a fast and flexible resume generator!
This Guide contains essential information for those seeking to maintain, or enhance ResuMaker.

Developers new to ResuMaker can refer to <<setting-up, Setting Up>> to get started. +
Experienced developers can find advanced details in <<Design-Architecture, Section 2>> and <<Implementation, Section 3>>.

[[setting-up]]
== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer
Follow these steps to set up the project in your computer for development:

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup
To verify that you have setup the project correctly:

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: Displays the App's User Interface.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Executes Commands.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of these four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` component simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

[[Implementation]]
== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::tags[]
=== Tags and Categories
Tags and categories are single-word keywords tied to individual entries. Each `ResumeEntry` can be classified under one `Category`, but can be associated with multiple `Tag`.

==== Categories
Category related functions are mainly contained in the `seedu.address.model.category` package, which includes the `Category` class and its relevant `CategoryManager`. `CategoryManager` is used by the `ModelManager` (`seedu.address.model.ModelManager`) to filter the list of entries by categories.

Filtering can be done by passing the relevant `Predicate<ResumeEntry>` into `CategoryManager` through `CategoryManger.setPredicate()`. The relevant filtered list can be obtained by subsequently calling `CategoryManager.getList()`.

==== CategoryManager
To use `CategoryManager` to filter out relevant entries, there are a few main functions to keep in mind:

* `setList(List<ResumeEntry> entries)`: sets the source list of entries to filter
* `getList()`: returns `unmodifiableObservableList<ResumeEntry>` of relevant entries
* `setPredicate(Predicate<ResumeEntry> predicate)`: sets the filtering criteria for the list of entries
* `mkPredicate(Predicate<ResumeEntry> predicate, String category)`: returns a predicate that builds onto the given predicate to filter by given category as well
* `mkPredicate(String category)`: return a predicate that filters entries by the category

===== Example: Listing entries from a certain category `tag ls ~work`
`CategoryManager` can be used to filter out certain entries for display in the UI.

----
CategoryManager categoryManager = new CategoryManager();
Predicate<ResumeEntry> predicate = categoryManager.mkPredicate("work");
modelManager.updateFilteredEntryList(predicate);
----

* A `Predicate<ResumeEntry>` will be generated by the command using `CategoryManager.mkPredicate()`
* This predicate is then passed along to `Model.filteredEntryList` for the that the display can be updated
* The diagram below illustrate the flow of the program if one were to implement use it in a `Command`

// TODO: update img to show mkPredicate
.Program flow for listing entries
image::categoryManager_example_listEntry.png[]

===== Example: Filtering entries to be written to resume
`CategoryManager` can be used to extract out the relevant resume entries to be included in the specific sections of the resume.

----
TagManager tagManager = new TagManager();
CategoryManager categoryManager = new CategoryManager();

categoryManager.setList(modelManager.getFullList());
categoryManager.setPredicate(categoryManager.mkPredicate(category));

tagManager.setList(categoryManager.getList());
tagManager.setPredicate(tagManager.mkPredicate(tags));
List<ResumeEntry> filtered = tagManager.getList();
----

* The full list obtained from `Model.filteredList` will be passed into the `CategoryManger` through `CategoryManager.setList()`
* Based on the filters on different sections of the template, a specific `Predicate<ResumeEntry>` will be created for that section
* The `Predicate<ResumeEntry>` created will be passed into the `CategoryManager` through `CategoryManager.setPredicate()`
* The list of entries to be printed will be retrieved through `CategoryManager.getList()`
* If there is further filtering to be done on tags, the same set of steps will be done on `TagManager`
* The diagram below illustrate the flow of the program if one were to implement use it in a `Command`

.Program flow for filtering out entries for resume generation
image::categoryManager_example_template.png[]

==== Predicates
The `CategoryManager` was written to help developers filter out desired predicates easily. As such, the `CategoryManager.mkPredicate()` is written to return a `Predicate<ResumeEntry>` which can be passed into other functions for the filtering process, be it for display or resume generation process.

There are two general forms of the function, `mkPredicate<String category>` and `mkPredicate(Predicate<ResumeEntry> entries, String category)`.

The first form of the function returns a predicate which returns true if the `ResumeEntry.getCategory().cateName == category`. In short, it will filter out entries of a particular category.

The second form of the function (`mkPredicate(Predicate<ResumeEntry> predicate, String category)`) extends the existing predicate and implement the category checking process on top of it. For the new predicate to return true, the `ResumeEntry` must fulfill the first `Predicate<ResumeEntry>` and also be of a particular specified category.

===== Example: Filtering entries using both tags and category `tag ls ~work #java #python`
This function is used to implement more complex filters, for example, when entries needs to be filtered by both tags and categories in `tag ls`.

----
TagManager tagManager = new TagManager();
CategoryManager categoryManager = new CategoryManager();

Predicate<ResumeEntry> predicate = categoryManager.mkPredicate(category);
predicate = tagManager.mkPredicate(predicate, tags);
modelManager.updateFilteredEntryList(predicate);
----

* A `Predicate<ResumeEntry>` will be generated by the command using `CategoryManager.mkPredicate()`
* This predicate is then passed along to `TagManager.mkPredicate()` to be extended to include tag filtering
* The combined predicate is passed to `Model.filteredList` for the display to be updated
* The diagram below illustrate the flow of the program if one were to implement use it in a `Command`

.Program flow for filtering out entries for both tag and category
image::categoryManager_example_tagls.png[]

==== Design considerations
There are 2 main ways to implement entries filtering: within `CategoryManager` itself or using `CategoryManager` to generate `Predicate<ResumeEntry>` to be used for filtering. Below are some evaluation as to why and when each of the methods may be relevant.

===== Alternative 1: Handles all the entries filtering within CategoryManager
This is implemented through `setList()`, `setPredicate()` and `getList()`. The full list of entries is passed in, and the filtered list of entries is returned. This will typically be used in the filtering of the entries in the resume generation process.

This method is much cleaner, encapsulating all the filtering process within `CategoryManger`. But if we are sticking to the current implementation of displaying the UI from a `FilteredList<ResumeEntry>`, this approach may not be appropriate, hence, the second alternative implementation, which gracefully handles this case.

**Example:**

- `setList(List<ResumeEntry>)` to set the full list of entries to filter from
- `setPredicate(mkPredicate(category))` to filter list based on category
- `getList()` to return list of filtered entries

===== Alternative 2: Using CategoryManager to build the desired Predicate
This is implemented through `mkPredicate()`. The function is used to build upon a given `Predicate<ResumeEntry>`. which can be passed into `ModelManager.updateFilteredEntryBook()` to filter the displayed list of entries in the UI.

This method allow us to utilize the original UI mechanism for updating the displaying using a predicate, instead of having to alter the list of entries over and over again.

**Example:**

- `Predicate<ResumeEntry>` obtained that does some preliminary filtering (e.g. filtering based on tags)
- `mkPredicate(predicate, category)` extends the original predicate to further filter by category
- `ModelManager.updateFilteredEntryList(predicate)` to update view of displayed entries

===== Current Implementation
Currently, a mixture of these functions are implemented. This allows the developers to use `CategoryManager` in both manner, whichever method they deem more appropriate.

// end::tags[]

// tag::template[]
=== Templates

A template specifies the format of the generated resume. It specifies the sections in the resume, and which entries should be included under each section based on a set of tags.

==== Template object structure

The diagram below shows the structure of a `Template` object. A `Template` contains an `ArrayList` of `TemplateSection`,
where each contains a title to be displayed and two predicates for filtering entries based on their category and tags.

.Template object UML class diagram
image::Template_UML.png[width="500"]

==== Template file
Templates are stored as text files, with each line in the following format:
----
[Category Heading]:~[Category Tag]:[Tag Groups]
----

The list of tags in `[Tag Groups]` can be treated as a sum of products form, where a `&` represents AND and space represents OR.
If no tags are specified, all entries with the `[Category Tag]` will be included.


Template files are written by the user and loaded into the application using the `loadtemplate` command.

==== Template loading sequence

The diagram below shows how the components interact when the user attempts to load a template using the `loadtemplate template1.txt` command.

.Component interactions for loadtemplate template1.txt command (part 1)
image::Template_SD1.png[width="800"]

The diagram below shows how `EventsCenter` reacts, raising a `TemplateLoadRequestedEvent` which prompts `Storage` to attempt to load the template from file.
If the loading was successful, it the text file will be parsed into a `Template` object, and passed into the `TemplateLoadedEvent`. This event will be handled in the `Model`, which will store the `Template` retrieved from the event.
Otherwise, a `TemplateLoadingExceptionEvent` will be raised and handled by `Model` as well.

// end::template[]

// tag::entryManagement[]
=== Entry Management
This section describes the implementation of features related to managing entries in ResuMaker, and explains the underlying classes and supporting data structures.

==== Construct Entry Related Classes

Below is the class diagram of classes under the package `seedu.address.model.entry`, which lays the foundation for the implementation of <<entryManagement, Entry Management>>

.Class diagram for entry related classes
image::classDiagramForEntry.png[width="800"]

* Current Implementation
.. As shown in the diagram, all data of an added entry in ResuMaker is encapsulated as a class `ResumeEntry`, which is composed of four other classes: namely one `Category`, one `EntryInfo`, one `EntryDescription` and multiple instances of `Tag`.
.. ResuMaker extends a `Taggable` interface which allows manipulation of tags associated with itself.


* Design Consideration
.. `Taggable` Interface +
Provides an additional abstraction layer for any class that needs to access methods that `ResumeEntry` overrides to implement `Taggable`. This enforces Interface Segregation Principle in which unrelated classes have limited knowledge about `ResumeEntry`.

.. Encapsulation of `EntryInfo` +
... Instead of lumping `title`, `subtitle` and `duration` in `ResumeEntry`, encapsulating the three into `EntryInfo` provides another layer of abstraction.
... Not all entries have the three information, a <<minorEntry, minor entry>> does not contain title, subtitle or duration. `EntryInfo` helps to differentiate <<minorEntry, minor entry>> from <<majorEntry, major entry>> using `isMinorEntry()`.

.. Encapsulation using `EntryDescription` +
... As opposed to putting an entry description as a `String` field in `ResumeEntry`, encapsulating it in `EntryDescription` provides another layer of abstraction.
... `EntryDescription` contains `List<String>` that allows for easy modification of a specific segment of the description of a particular entry, i.e. allows users to edit a particular line of description in that entry.

==== Responsive Display of Expanded Entry
This enhancement enables the Graphic User Interface to display the description of an entry responsively to any modification of an entry.

* Current Implementation +
.. The high level interaction between different components follows the same workflow as any other commands. +
Diagram(part a) below illustrates the high level interaction between different components when an `addBullet` or `editBullet` command is executed.
.. A noteworthy point is that it makes use of event driven design to allow UI to respond to Logic.
`EventCenter` acts as the receiver of the three events raised by Logic and sends them to the respective handlers of these events.
For `addBullet` command, the handlers of events raised are UI and Storage. Please refer to diagram(part b) below for more detail.

.Sequence diagram for adding a bullet description to an entry (part a)
image::SequenceDiagramAddBullet_1.png[width="800"]
.Sequence diagram for adding a bullet description to an entry (part b)
image::SequenceDiagramAddBullet_2.png[width="800"]



* Design Consideration

.. Minimizing the amount of code to be added by tapping on the existing utility +
Given how well-established event driven approach is, it will be more convenient to adopt it to minimize the addition of lines of code.
Taking the alternative would mean extra code to be added to establish some form of reference of UI in Logic.

.. Decoupling between Logic and UI +
Rather than asking Logic to interact directly with UI to request for changes in UI, which increases coupling between the two, `EventCenter` acts as the
"middle man" to minimize coupling.




//end::entryManagement[]



// tag::resume[]
=== Resume Generation
This section describes the implementation of the resume generation feature, explains the underlying classes and
supporting data structures, and highlights areas that are open to extension.

==== Resume Structure

The `Resume` contains a list of `ResumeSections`,
each comprising a title and a list of `ResumeEntries` associated with it
(as stipulated by the `Template` used to generate the `Resume`). +
_[CLASS DIAGRAM]_

==== Storage Management

When a resume is to be saved to a file, the `ModelManager` raises a `ResumeSaveEvent`, which encapsulates
the complete `Resume` as well as the specified file `Path`. This event is captured by the `StorageManager`,
which passes the data to the `MarkdownResumeStorage` class. The `Resume` object is then converted to a markdown `String`
by the `MarkdownConverter` utility class, after which it is written to a file (with the specified name) by the `MdUtil` class. +
_[DIAGRAM]_


==== Markdown Conversion

To transform this abstract object representation of the `Resume` into concrete text,
the `MarkdownConverter` utility class progressively converts each level of the `Resume`
(from the titles, information and descriptions of each individual `ResumeEntry`,
to a `ResumeSection` of `ResumeEntries` and finally the full `Resume`)
into a `String` containing its formatted markdown representation.

An external link:https://github.com/Steppschuh/Java-Markdown-Generator[Java Markdown Generator] library
was used to handle the generation of the markdown `String` in `MarkdownConverter`,
as it was built on a `Builder` pattern which made it easier and more organised to progressively
generate markdown text for each part of the resume and combine it all together in the end.

==== Possible Extensions

===== Changing Markdown Layouts

If you wish to modify the markdown layout produced by ResuMaker, look into the overloaded `toMarkdown` method
within `MarkdownConverter`. The various versions of this method are implemented using the
link:https://github.com/Steppschuh/Java-Markdown-Generator[Java Markdown Generator] external library and designed to be
easy to understand and modify. +
You are recommended to create a new subclass of `MarkdownConverter` and `@Override` its `toMarkdown` method
with your own versions, so as to preserve the original functionality of the application for reference.

===== Adding File Formats

While we have chosen to implement conversion into markdown, you may prefer a different file format and want to avoid
the hassle of converting markdown to other formats outside the application. To this end, you can extend ResuMaker by
adding support for saving `Resumes` to a new format. +
To achieve this, you would have to design your own class implementing the `ResumeStorage` interface. This new class would
then need new utility methods to handle conversion of the `Resume` into another text format, such as XML. +
_[DIAGRAM OF NECESSARY ADDITIONS]_


// end::resume[]

// tag:: contextualAwareness[]
=== Contextual Awareness

==== Key Terms
Here are some terms that are used often when discussing Contexual Awareness. +
Please review their definitions in the Glossary before reading further. +

* <<event, Events>>
* <<slang, Slang>>
* <<partial-phrase, Partial phrases>>
* <<full-phrase, Full phrases>>
* <<expression, Expression>>

==== Overview
Contextual Awareness enables ResuMaker to: +

* Create pre-filled ResumeEntries for standard <<event, Events>>.
* Understand slang and partial phrases in the user's input.

The flowchart below illustrates the overall flow taken by an end-user when working with the Contextual Awareness feature. +

image::AwarenessFlow.png[width="800"]

The flowchart highlights the 4 separate steps involved in the Contextual Awareness feature:

1. Providing feedback to the user, as he types in an `<expression>`.
2. Guessing an Event name, based on the user provided `<expression>`.
3. Matching the guessed Event name, with an actual Event, as defined in the user provided data.
4. Creating a ResumeEntry for the matched Event.

In this guide, we will discuss Steps 2, and 3.

==== Guessing an Event name, based on user provided `<expression>`
To guess the Event name, we parse the `slang`, `partial phrases` and `full phrases` in the `expression` to get a `possibleEventName`.
This parsing is done by the `Awareness` class.

As shown <<Design-Storage, earlier>>, an instance of the Awareness class is initialised from user provided XML data, upon startup.

The following Figure shows the structure of the Awareness class.

image::awarenessStructure.png[width="600"]

Parsing the `slang`, `partial phrases` and `full phrases` is a 2-step process:

First, use the `dictionary` (see Figure) to replace each `slang` with its corresponding `full phrase`. +
After this step, the `expression` will only contain `partial phrases` and `full phrases`. +
Now, replace each `partial phrase` with its corresponding `full phrase`.

This gives us a string of `full phrases`, which is our `possibleEventName`.

As an example, suppose our initial `expression` was: `ug research assist`.
In this `expression`, we have:

* A slang (`ug` - slang for `undegraduate`)
* A partial phrase (`assist` - short for `assistant`)
* A full phrase (`research`)

After the first step, our expression will be `undergraduate research assist`. +
After the second step, our expression will be `undergraduate research assistant` +
Thus, our `possibleEventName` will be `undergraduate research assistant`.

==== Matching the guessed Event Name, with an actual Event [Work In Progress]

Work in Progress


==== Design Choices

===== ContextCommand
The ContextCommand is constructed by passing it a CommandSupplier.
This construction is done by ContextCommandParser.
When it is time to `execute` the ContextCommand, the CommandSupplier supplies the relevant command.

Pros:

* ContextCommand can be decoupled from specific commands like AddCommand.
* ContextCommand can be _extended_ to perform any type of Command, by passing the relevant CommandSupplier.

Alternatives:

* Create different types of ContextCommands for different purpose: i.e. ContextAddCommand, ContextFindCommand, etc

The alternative may be equally valid.

===== Awareness class
The Awareness class is constructed by passing it a Dictionary containing slang - full phrase mappings.

Alternatives:

* Create the Dictionary instance within the constructor of Awareness, rather than accepting it.

Pros:

* Increased testability as the dependancy (Dictionary object) _can be controlled_ since it is passed into the constructor.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
