== PROJECT: ResuMaker

== Overview

This portfolio aims to introduce a software engineering project I participated in and
highlight my contributions to it, both technical and otherwise.
This project was done as part of a Software Engineering module during my Computer Science studies
at the National University of Singapore's School of Computing (NUS SoC),
Over a period of 6 weeks, my team of 5 students developed a
Resume Generation app targeted specifically at students of NUS SoC.

The project entailed morphing an existing medium scale software product
(about 6000 lines of code) into a totally new product
while learning and applying software engineering best practices.
It also imposed various constraints on the final product, such as
having to focus on only taking input from a Command Line Interface (CLI)
and requiring an incremental approach to development.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to generate a resume and save it to a file*.
**	This enhancement uses the specifications of a given template to filter and organise the entries stored in ResuMaker
into a visually appealing resume file, saved in the markdown format for easy conversion to other commonly used document formats.
**  This enhancement is a core feature of the project and brings together the work of the team to generate a resume.
**	This enhancement was designed to be modular enough to allow for easy extension.
For instance, the use of markdown to format the text of the resume was designed such that it would be easy to
change the layout of the resume (such as changing the font size of its section headers
or adding other content to the resume) or even switch to a different file format altogether.
**	This enhancement made use of an link:https://github.com/Steppschuh/Java-Markdown-Generator[external library] to handle the
generation of markdown text in a more organised way rather than manipulating the text directly.
While this functionality was important, it is not essential to the feature - generating the markdown text of the resume
could have been done without it, although it would have either taken more work to develop the functionality separately
or been much messier.

Functional code snippet:
```
    public Resume(Model model) {
        requireAllNonNull(model);
        this.model = model;

        template = model.getLoadedTemplate()
                .orElseThrow(() -> new IllegalArgumentException("Template cannot be blank."));
        requireAllNonNull(template);

        resumeHeader = new ResumeHeader(model.getUserParticulars());
        requireAllNonNull(resumeHeader);

        resumeSectionList = new ArrayList<>();
        populateSectionList();
    }

    /**
     * Populates the section list by using each TemplateSection to fetch a set of entries belonging to that section.
     */
    private void populateSectionList() {
        ArrayList<TemplateSection> templateSections = template.getSections();
        for (TemplateSection templateSection : templateSections) {
            resumeSectionList.add(fetchSectionEntries(templateSection));
        }
    }

    /**
     * Fetches a ResumeSection containing entries which match the tags specified in the
     * @param templateSection and
     * @return the ResumeSection containing the entries specified.
     */
    private ResumeSection fetchSectionEntries(TemplateSection templateSection) {
        Predicate<ResumeEntry> sectionPredicate = templateSection.getCategoryPredicate()
                .and(templateSection.getTagPredicate());
        return new ResumeSection(templateSection.getTitle(),
                model.getFilteredEntryList(sectionPredicate));
    }
```

Test code snippet:
```
    @Test
    public void resumeConstructorTest() {
        // no template loaded
        assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, "Template cannot be blank.", () -> new Resume(new ModelManager()));

        Model testModel = TypicalResumeModel.getDefaultTemplateModel();

        // default template, no entries
        Resume blankResume = new Resume(testModel);
        List<ResumeSection> expectedBlankSectionList = new ArrayList<>();
        Template defaultTemplate = Template.getDefaultTemplate();
        for (TemplateSection templateSection : defaultTemplate.getSections()) {
            expectedBlankSectionList.add(new ResumeSection(templateSection.getTitle(), new ArrayList<ResumeEntry>()));
        }
        assertEquals(expectedBlankSectionList, blankResume.getSectionList());

        // default template, typical entries
        List<ResumeEntry> typicalEntries = TypicalEntrys.getTypicalEntries();
        for (ResumeEntry entry : typicalEntries) {
            testModel.addEntry(entry);
        }
        Resume typicalResume = new Resume(testModel);
        // filtering entries manually to get expected section list
        List<ResumeSection> expectedTypicalSectionList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (TemplateSection templateSection : defaultTemplate.getSections()) {
            List<ResumeEntry> testEntryList = new ArrayList<>();
            for (ResumeEntry entry : typicalEntries) {
                if (templateSection.getCategoryPredicate().test(entry)
                        && templateSection.getTagPredicate().test(entry)) {
                    testEntryList.add(entry);
                }
            }
            expectedTypicalSectionList.add(new ResumeSection(templateSection.getTitle(), testEntryList));
        }
        assertEquals(expectedTypicalSectionList, typicalResume.getSectionList());
    }
