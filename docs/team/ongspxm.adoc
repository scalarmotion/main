== PROJECT: ResuMaker

---

== Overview

This portfolio showcases my contributions for a software engineering team project for our software engineering module. In a period of 6 weeks, we were tasked to implement a command line interface (CLI) based application targeted at a specific group of users.

Our project, ResuMaker, is a fast and flexible resume generator, optimised for students in the School of Computing. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLo.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *tag management system*
** What it does: This enhancement allows the user to use tags to identify resume entries to include in the display or resume output.
** Justification: This enhancement allows ResuMaker to achieve one of its highlights: ability to selectively include specific entries to include in the resume creation process.
** Highlights: This enhancement will be needed for many of the other features, therefore many implementation details have to be considered to cater for the various different usages of the tags in the application.

* *Minor enhancement*: added commands to alter existing tags of entries
Instead of having to reinsert entries, addition tag management functions have been implement to add, remove and replace tags. This will streamline the process of managing existing resume entries giving users more control over
** What it does: This enhancement allows the user to alter tags of existing entries
** Justification: This enhancement streamlines the tag management process, instead of having to reinsert entries, users can make use of the functions to alter the tags instead.
